So, it happens that my attempt at transmuting my master's thesis into a suitable article precipitated the first crystal and the resulting matter is ready to be examined by colleagues around the globe. It took a few (many) rounds of preliminary versions, but Yvan and I reached a satisfactory point and felt it had ripped into something suitable for submission to a scientific journal.

If your curiosity has been awaken and you feel you cannot read any further, please do have a look here: [19.09.03499](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03499). (This number means that it is the 3499th preprint submitted to arXiv this month; I find it suitable that my first article managed to grab a prime number 3499.) Don't be afraid, this is loaded with examples and an astonishing number of diagrams!

However, you might want to read a bit more before going away. Albeit we worked very hard to make the article understandable by our readers, there are some digressions that would not be suited for the scientific format; hence, this blog post!

The purpose of this piece is simply to present the work done. I put three[^1] sections according to the level of mathematics you are ready to take. 

## No mathematics for me

You are giving me a hard challenge, but I shall try my hand to it!



## A single dose of mathematics, I know linear algebra

Ah, you know enough to follow me with some technical details!  The article lays in the are of mathematics called representation theory (source). This area follows the idea that the only thing we can handle properly is linear algebra. 

This may seems like a bold claim and it is slightly over inflated, but reducing problems to linear algebra problems has been one of the most fruitful avenue of work in mathematics and in science. 

So, each time I say "representation", just assume I am speaking of a vector space populated with many matrices; each time I employ "irreducible representation" think that the matrices populating your vector space cannot be divided, contrary to say block-diagonal matrices, and when I say "bilinear form" think of a kind of inner product.

In this article, we are trying to classify the finite-dimensional representations of a certain algebraic structure that is linked to a physical system. This structure, the seam algebra, is parametrized by an integer $n$, another integer $k\geq 2$ and a complex parameter $q$. We started our study by proving that the structure we are studying has a nice property shared by many other interesting algebras: it is cellular. This means that a special family or representations, the cell representations, includes naturally a bilinear form encoding some information. Those representations are indexed by the integers between $0$ and $n+k$ of same parity, so $1,3, \dots , n+k$ if $n+k$ is odd and $0,2,\dots , n+k$ if it is even.

The second step is to study the bilinear form. We did so by finding a decomposition of the bilinear form of the rank $d$ for the algebra of parameters $n,k$ in the bilinear forms of rank $d-1$ and $d+2$ for the algebra of parameters $n-1,k$. 



## Double dose, you have before you a scholar of algebra



## Usually, I am the one giving the course

 If you belong in this section of people, than I have nothing more to offer than the actual paper, go have a look if you want to see: [19.09.03499](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03499).

 

[^1]: Yes, I do know how to count to three, and I am aware that I put four sections below, I might be a bit influenced by my computer scientist colleagues!
