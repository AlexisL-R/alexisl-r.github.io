So, it happens that my attempt at transmuting my master's thesis into a suitable article precipitated the first crystal and the resulting matter is ready to be examined by colleagues around the globe. It took a few (many) rounds of preliminary versions, but Yvan and I reached a satisfactory point and felt it had ripped into something suitable for submission to a scientific journal.

If your curiosity has been awaken and you feel you cannot read any further, please do have a look here: [19.09.03499](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03499). (This number means that it is the 3499th preprint submitted to arXiv this month; I find it suitable that my first article managed to grab a prime number 3499.) Don't be afraid, this is loaded with examples and an astonishing number of diagrams!

However, you might want to read a bit more before going away. Albeit we worked very hard to make the article understandable by our reader, there are some digression that would not be suited for the scientific format; hence, this blog post!

The purpose of this piece is simply to present the work done. I put three sections according to the level of mathematics you are ready to take

## No mathematics for me

You are giving me a hard challenge, but I shall try my hand to it!



## A single dose of mathematics, I know linear algebra



## Double dose, you have before you a scholar of algebra



## Usually, I am the one giving course
