	<p>
For archival purposes, the potential future subjects of the Kleine seminar are collected here.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Crystal Bases</h2>
	
	<p>
			The goal of this future semester of the seminar would be to go through the recent book by Daniel Bump and Anne Schilling, Crystal Bases. Representations and Combinatorics. 
			 <a href="https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/crystal-bases">MAA's review</a>, <a href="https://zbmath.org/?q=an%3A1440.17001">zbMATH's review</a> </li>
	</p>
	
	<h2>Finishing Humphreys</h2>
	<p>
		Finish Chapter 8 of Humphreys's book on category $\mathcal{O}$ and maybe seek to do a bit in the remaining chapters.	
	</p>
	
<h2>Tensor categories</h2>
	<p>
		Etingof, Gelaki, Nikshych and Ostrik have written recently a book on tensor categories (see <a href="https://pages.uoregon.edu/vostrik/">https://pages.uoregon.edu/vostrik/</a> and navigate to the book).
		In the preface, they outline a possible one-semester course that we could do to cover this exciting material.
	</p>

<h2>Yangians and classical Lie algebras</h2>
<p>Study the 2007 book by Mole5Sv</p>

<h2>Dirac operators in Representation Theory</h2>
<p>
	To follow Huang's and Pandzic's book on their proof of Vogan's conjecture on Dirac cohomology titled Dirac operators in Representation Theory.
