	<p>
For archival purposes, the potential future subjects of the Kleine seminar are collected here.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Crystal Bases</h2>
	
	<p>
			The goal of this future semester of the seminar would be to go through the recent book by Daniel Bump and Anne Schilling, Crystal Bases. Representations and Combinatorics. 
			 <a href="https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/crystal-bases">MAA's review</a>, <a href="https://zbmath.org/?q=an%3A1440.17001">zbMATH's review</a> </li>
	</p>
	
	<h2>Finishing Humphreys</h2>
	<p>
		Finish Chapter 8 of Humphreys's book on category $\mathcal{O}$ and maybe seek to do a bit in the remaining chapters.	
	</p>
	
<h2>Soergel bimodules</h2>
	<p>
		Soergel bimodules are important objects in representation theory in the landscape for the last twenty years. Recently a book on the subject was published: Introduction to Soergel bimodules. 
		The book contains lectures by Elias, Makisumi, Thiel and Williamson written by attendants. 
	</p>

<h2>Yangians and classical Lie algebras</h2>
<p>Study the 2007 book by Molev</p>

<h2>Dirac operators in Representation Theory</h2>
<p>
	To follow Huang's and Pandzic's book on their proof of Vogan's conjecture on Dirac cohomology titled Dirac operators in Representation Theory.
