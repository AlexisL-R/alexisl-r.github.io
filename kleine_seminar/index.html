	<p> 
	Welcome to the website of the Kleine seminar! This small seminar takes place at Universiteit Gent and was initiated in summer 2019 to create a space 
	for graduate students and postdoc researchers with shared research interests to study recent subject in depth. The method is quite simple:
	each semester, the members meet and decide of one subject they want to investigate, then they choose a base reference and divide the subject amongst
	themselves so that each of them will present a part. It aims to keep an informal ambiance and every kind of questions is welcomed, especially

<h4>Subject</h4>
<p> 
We will follow Humphrey's Representations of Semisimple Lie algebras in the BGG category $$\mathcal{O}$$ <a href="https://zbmath.org/?q=an%3A1177.17001">zbMATH's review</a>
			of Humphreys (see for example this group in Columbia that had the same idea 
			<a href="https://www.math.columbia.edu/~hliu/seminars/s20-category-o.html">https://www.math.columbia.edu/~hliu/seminars/s20-category-o.html</a> ) </li>
</p>
	

	<h4>Next meeting: Thursday 14th of January, 14:00 CET, organisational session   </h4>
	
	<p> 
	We will discuss the book, divide the sections amongst the present members and decide of a recurring date for our meetings.

		You can find here <a href= "/kleine_seminar/notes/">the note of the meeting</a>. The material has probably a high chance of being error-filled here,
		but the margins content some hastily scribbled snippets of the discussion we had in the seminar and might prove interesting!
