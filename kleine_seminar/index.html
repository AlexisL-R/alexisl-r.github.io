	<p> 
	Welcome to the website of the Kleine seminar! This small seminar takes place at Universiteit Gent and was initiated in summer 2019 to create a space 
	for graduate students and postdoc researchers with shared research interests to study recent subject in depth. The method is quite simple:
	each semester, the members meet and decide of one subject they want to investigate, then they choose a base reference and divide the subject amongst
	themselves so that each of them will present a part. It aims to keep an informal ambiance and every kind of questions is welcomed, especially 
	<a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/ask-yourself-dumb-questions-and-answer-them/">dumb ones</a>! 
	</p>
	
	<h2>Current topic, Fall 2019</h2>
		<h3>Hecke algebras and double affine Hecke algebras</h3>
	<p>
		This semester topic is on Hecke algebras with a view toward double affine Hecke algebras (DAHA). The reference we are following is the book Iwahori-Hecke Algebra
		and Schur Algebras of the Symmetric Group by Andrew Mathas and Pavel Etingof's course notes on DAHA. Some more references are in the shared files, only available
		for UGent members. We will complete in Mathas chapters 1 to 3 completely, part of chapter 4 and add some material on DAHA after.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		We hope to run the seminar weekly for each speaker with possible breaks in between. The current location is <strong>Leslokaal 2.3 S8</strong>,
		the specific date and time is still under review.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Next meeting Wednesday December 4th 16h00-17h15 2.3 S8 on Chapter 3 section 4. The presenter is Wouter van de Vijver</h4>
	
	<p>
		The presentation will be on the section 3.4 on irreducible modules classification. This talk will conclude chapter 3 by proving the theorem of James and Dipper (3.43).

	<h4>Past meetings</h4>
		<u1>
			<li>Tuesday November 26th, Sam Claerabout finished section 3.3 by proving the orthogonality of the basis elements and Wouter van de Vijver returned to an example of
			irreducible modules via the Murphy basis</li>
			<li>Tuesday November 19th, Sam Claerabout presented the Specht modules for the Hecke algebra in section 3.3</li>
			<li>Tuesday November 12th, Sigiswald Barbier presented the Murphy basis theorem of section 3.2 and related lemmas.</li>			
			<li>Tuesday November 05th, Sigiswald Barbier presented the theorem of Ehresmann of section 3.1 and related lemmas.</li>			
			<li>Tuesday October 22th, Alexis Langlois-Rémillard presented the last part of the second chapter of Mathas. Proof of lemmas 2.18, 2.9 and of theorem 2.20 were given. 
			Sigiswald Barbier then started the study of chapter 3 with the beginning of section 1. Reaching Corollary 3.4.</li>		
			<li>Tuesday October 8th, Alexis Langlois-Rémillard presented the second part of the second chapter of Mathas. We reached theorem 2.20, skipping lemmas 2.18 and 2.19 </li>
			<li>Friday October 4th, Alexis Langlois-Rémillard presented the first part of the second chapter of Mathas on Cellular algebra. We reached the statement of theorem 2.16 on a 
				complete list of non-equivalent simple modules in a cellular algebras (Theorem 2.16)</li>
			<li>Thursday September 19th, Asmus Bisbo presented the first chapter of Mathas on introduction to Hecke algebras and some preliminary results on the symmetric group</li>

		<p>
		In the second presentation, Sigiswald will finish the first section on combinatorics of Young tableau and will have in his hands the tools to prove that we basis 
		he constructed is in face a cellular basis for the Hecke algebras. To follow clearly, it might be interesting to revise what is a cellular basis and to check again the 
		definitions introduced on Young tableaux and shape.	
		</p>
		<p>	
		The first section of chapter 3 is dedicated to the combinatorics of Young tableaux with in mind the construction of the cell basis of the Hecke algebra linked to the
		permutation group. We will continue from Corollary 3.4 and address some concerns about gab to be filled.
		</p>
		Description of second part, to be kept until we decide what to do, or if we gather the strenght to dispose of it
		The subject covered in this session will aim to be the first section of Chapter 2, stopping at Theorem 2.16. Alexis suggested that interested
		members should consult Appendix A of the book for a refreshment (or initiation) in representation theory of algebras. Also, it would be wise
		to read beforehand the definition of cellular algebras and work out example (i) of 2.2.
		
		Part 2 will start from the proof of Theorem 2.16 (giving a complete set of unequivalent simple modules) and hope to reach and prove theorem 2.20 giving
		the relation between the decomposition matrix of the algebra and its Cartan matrix (respectively the matrix with entries the composition multiplicities
		of the simple module in cell module and composition multiplicities of simple modules in principal modules). A refreshment on projective modules would 
		be wise, but might be skipped.
		
		Part 3 will finish the second chapter by proving the theorem 2.20 and the needed lemmas. To <em>prepare</em>, one would refresh oneself with the flateness property of projective
		and refresh the vocabulary we introduced last session. -->

		but the margins content some hastily scribbled snippets of the discussion we had in the seminar and might prove interesting!
