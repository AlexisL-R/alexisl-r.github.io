	<p> 
	Welcome to the website of the Kleine seminar! This small seminar takes place at Universiteit Gent and was initiated in summer 2019 to create a space 
	for graduate students and postdoc researchers with shared research interests to study recent subject in depth. The method is quite simple:
	each semester, the members meet and decide of one subject they want to investigate, then they choose a base reference and divide the subject amongst
	themselves so that each of them will present a part. It aims to keep an informal ambiance and every kind of questions is welcomed, especially 
	<a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/ask-yourself-dumb-questions-and-answer-them/">dumb ones</a>! 
	</p>

<h4>Subject</h4>
<p> 
We will follow Humphrey's Representations of Semisimple Lie algebras in the BGG category $\mathcal{O}$, <a href="https://zbmath.org/?q=an%3A1177.17001">zbMATH's review</a>
			(see for example this group in Columbia that had the same idea 
			<a href="https://www.math.columbia.edu/~hliu/seminars/s20-category-o.html">https://www.math.columbia.edu/~hliu/seminars/s20-category-o.html</a> ). </li>
</p>

<p>We will try to keep the session streamlined: doing only the proofs that add something, maybe do some proof for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ or $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ if it is not trivial. 
The audience will try to skim through the material beforehand </p>
	

	<h4>Next meeting: Tuesday 9th February 15:00 CET our third and last step with the chapter 1: Basics of Category $\mathcal{O}$ by Alexis Langlois-Rémillard  </h4>
	
	<p> 
	We cover the first chapter of the book on the basics of category $\mathcal{O}$. Our goal will be to end the chapter from Section 1.11.
	</p>
