	<p> 
	Welcome to the website of the Kleine seminar! This small seminar takes place at Universiteit Gent and was initiated in summer 2019 to create a space 
	for graduate students and postdoc researchers with shared research interests to study recent subject in depth. The method is quite simple:
	each semester, the members meet and decide of one subject they want to investigate, then they choose a base reference and divide the subject amongst
	themselves so that each of them will present a part. It aims to keep an informal ambiance and every kind of questions is welcomed, especially 
	<a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/ask-yourself-dumb-questions-and-answer-them/">dumb ones</a>! 
	</p>


	<h4>Next meeting: Friday 15th October 13:15 to 14:15</h4>
	
	<p> 
	Kieran will break the ice with a small freshener on Chap 1 and the beginning of Chapter 2.

<h4>Resources for the seminar</h4>
<p> 

Etingof, Gelaki, Nikshych and Ostrik have written recently a book on tensor categories (see <a href="https://pages.uoregon.edu/vostrik/">https://pages.uoregon.edu/vostrik/</a> and navigate to the book).
		In the preface, they outline a possible one-semester course that we could do to cover this exciting material. Here is it with minor touch
