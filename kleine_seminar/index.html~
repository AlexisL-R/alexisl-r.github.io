	<p> 
	Welcome to the website of the Kleine seminar! This small seminar takes place at Universiteit Gent and was initiated in summer 2019 to create a space 
	for graduate students and postdoc researchers with shared research interests to study recent subject in depth. The method is quite simple:
	each semester, the members meet and decide of one subject they want to investigate, then they choose a base reference and divide the subject amongst
	themselves so that each of them will present a part. It aims to keep an informal ambiance and every kind of questions is welcomed, especially
