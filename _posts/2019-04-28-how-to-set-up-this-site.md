After toying with the idea a bit, I got convinced rather easily to set up my personal website. It is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), is pretty simple and will contain possibly interesting elements. I used this very comprehensive [step-by-step guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) by Jonathan McGlone and host the website on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I would definitively not be the best person to contact for help in those matter, but feel free to do so!
