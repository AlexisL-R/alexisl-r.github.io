<p>
	This is a collection of my applications for postdocs in 2022. Postdoc seeking is painful, but I hope this little page can help. If you want any source or documents, contact me and I'll be pleased to share. (I would share them there, but I realise this HTML website is a bit painful to update.)
</p>

<h2>
	General tips
</h2>

<li>
	Be prepared to apply to a lot of places.
</li>
<li>
	Always contact someone of the place if you are applying somewhere. Even if they don't answer you, at least they will know.
</li>
<li>
	Mention to your supervisors, collaborators, friends and colleagues that you are looking for a postdoc. You never know who is looking for postdocs and people cannot help you if they don't know you are looking out.
</li>
<li>
	Warn in advance the people who will give you reference letters.
</li>
<li>
Websites and official applications are very good, but there is a big hidden postdoc market that you can only access through people's network. (If you let me know you are searching a postdoc, I will transfer you potential position that could be interesting for you.)
</li>
<li>
	Ask for help! People around you are willing to, we all know how painful looking for postdoc or position is. Also, sometime the website of mathematicians you admire contains wonders. (Shootout at the marvellous <a href="https://www.dtubbenhauer.com/">Daniel Tubbenhauer</a>, their website inspired me quite a bit for example!)

<h2>2022 Applications</h2>
<p>In 2022, I made 9 postdoc applications and got a positive answer from 4 of them. I’ll survey the applications below and give the documents. The place I wanted the most was Bonn, and so I tried to apply to everything that was linked to it to maximize my chances.</p>
<p>My project was quite similar through the applications (but you can see how it changed through the applications). The improvement to your project is a good side effect of multiple applications!</p>

<h3>(0) Leipzig :)</h3>
<p>This postdoc was obtained by surprise in a sense. I had contacted Érika Roldán-Roa for an outreach piece in January 2022 and in April 2022, they contacted me saying they had obtained a 5-year position at Leipzig Max Planck Institute and would like to invite me to work. I came one week in August 2022 and they offered me a postdoc if I would be interested. The offer was for 1 year and a half and I ended up taking half year since I got an offer at the HCM. We discussed it again in November at a conference, and finalised everything in January when I got my offer from HCM.</p>
<p>Submission: nothing.
Lesson: luck helps, but contacting people helps even more!</p>

<h3>(1-2) Cambridge :(</h3>
<p>I applied to two colleges, Emmanuel and Gonville-Caius. The submission was in September. I did not get long-listed.</p>
<p>The selectiveness of college postdocs is quite harsh. You compete against people from every disciplines. On the good side, the application is quite ligh before the interview so I would say they are worth trying even if chances are low. I contacted someone there, but not from the college so they did not have something to say in the process.
I received answer in December and January</p>

<p>
Documents: I had to answer a quite unclear form online and give out a research statement for general academic public. <a href= "/Postdocs/Doc/2022_Emmanuel_Research_Statement.pdf">Emmanuel</a> was only 1000 words and <a href=",/Doc/2022_Gonville_Caius_Research_Statement.pdf">Gonville-Caius</a>, 2000.
</p>
<h3>(3) FRQNT :)</h3>
<p>I applied to a 2-year postdoc scholarship of the FRQNT for a place in Bonn. This is only for Québec residents. I was the only one in my category for the postdoc, so I would advise to apply. They are also quite good (55000 CAD/year if you are outside Québec, 45000 CAD if in Québec) and they can be cumulated.</p>
<p>Deadline was begin October; I received an answer end April

Documents (in French): The applications <a href="./Doc/2022_LR_FRQNT.pdf">uploaded files</a>  (the full document is available if you email me).</p>

<h3>(4) Oxford :(</h3>
<p>I applied to one college in Oxford, Magdalen college. It is quite similar to Cambridge. I would say it seems better to obtain feedback from someone from Oxbridge in those kind of postdoc: most of the elected candidates are from those two universities so I think there is a better way to prepare the application. I did not get longlisted.
Deadline was in October
I received an answer in February</p>
<p>Document: <a href="/Postdocs/Doc/2022_Magdalen_Research_Statement.pdf">Research statement</a> </p>
<h3>(5) MPI Bonn :(</h3>
<p>2 years postdoc The process to apply is quite easy and they were very quick at denying me. I would recommend highly contacting someone beforehand, sadly there was no one that I felt confortable contacting before. At least I received an email from Peter Scholze.
One deadline was in October but there are three other moments to convene. I had an answer quite quickly in November.

<h3>(6) HCM Hausdorff Postdoc :)</h3>
<p>This is the main postdoc I aimed at. I had 4 references letters, and I contacted my potential mentor well in advance.</p>
<p>Deadline October 2022

Answer Mid January 2023

Start October 2023

<h3>(7) Glasgow :|</h3>
<p>This 3 years postdoc was quite unexpected: a colleague of my supervisor received funding in Glasgow for a project that fitted me quite well. It was online only for 1 month and I would have missed it without the email since  I was intent on writing my thesis. I contacted the two responsible of the projects for some more detail and to know how flexible was the starting date (it was a bit earlier than I could do). I got taken in interview and ended up being the back up candidate. I visited them in Glasgow afterwards (a nice side effect of applications sometime: even if you end up not being taken, you get a bit more known).</p>
<p>Deadline: December 2022

Interview: December 2022

Answer: January 2023

Lesson: even if you are a good fit and do good, there can be better candidates, but it's also worth applying because you might get into contact for nice projects.'</p>

<h3>(8) Aalto :|</h3>
<p>This last postdoc was pointed out to me by my mentor at the HCM. She had funding in Aalto and was also looking for postdoc there. The application was the same then for the HCM and since I got that one I did not get it.</p>
<p>Deadline: December 2022

Answer: February 2023

<h2>Postdocs I planned to apply to</h2>
<p>I did a first wave of applications in September-October, but I had to stop to finish my PhD. I was quite lucky that I did not have to do the second round, but I intended to apply to other positions in the UK, scholarships in Germany (DFG and Humboldt) and seek positions in France from professors.</p>
