<h2>Schedule</h2>

The 90 min lectures will take place Mondays 8:00 to 10:00 in Zeichensaal, Wegelerstr. 10. Precisely, the lectures take place from 8:15-9:00, health break, 9:05 to 9:50. The two last lectures, however, will be in SR0.008 from the Math Institute Endenicher Allee 60 Monday 21.07.2025 at 10-12 and Tuesday 15-17.

<p>
 The following lecture notes give roughly what we followed from the book and provide the extra material I extracted from other sources (Mainly Mathas' book Iwahori-Hecke algebras and Schur algebras of the symmetric group).
</p>


<h3>
Remarks 
</h3>

<p>
30-06-2025 and 07-07-2025 There won't be any lecture. However, recorded snippets on the material will be available on Scibo file: https://uni-bonn.sciebo.de/s/tPBFi7A4MYL3kgr .
</p>


<p>
23.06.2025 Chris Bowman agreed to give a closing lecture on the Counterexample to the Lusztig Conjecture! It will be a 2h lecture in the afternoon of July 22nd 15:00-17:00 in SR0.008. (Small note, this material is outside the evaluation, so it will be pure enjoyment.)
</p>

<p>
16.06.2025 Class cancelled
</p>

<p>
05.05.2025 We covered a bit of cellular algebra theory. I've written up the notes in the exercise sheet with some extra details on the proofs we did not do in class. 
</p>

<p>
28.04.2025 In this lecture, I have given a bit on the physical motivation of the TL algebras and variations. It's a bit hard to suggest good reference on this. I suggest: P. Martin, Potts Models and Related Problems in Statistical Mechanics, Volume 5 of Advances in Statistical Mechanics. World Scientific,Singapore, 1991. and R. Baxter, Exactly Solved Models in Statistical Mechanics. Academic
Press, London, 1982. <a href="/teaching/S2025_Bonn_Diagrammatic/2025-04-28_Notes_Diag_alg_ALR.pdf">The scanned course notes</a> might help. 
</p>

<p>
14.04.2025 In this lecture, we followed Ridout and Saint-Aubin. Standard modules, induction and the structure of the Temperley-Lieb algebra. Adv. Theo. Math. Phys. 18.5 pp 957-1041 (2014) <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.4310/ATMP.2014.v18.n5.a1">https://dx.doi.org/10.4310/ATMP.2014.v18.n5.a1</a>.
</p>

<p>
	Notes of the lectures will appear here. We will be roughly following Chris Bowman's book «Diagrammatic algebra» (to appear). In general, I will only provide notes when I depart from the book.  A (virtual) copy of the book will be shared with students at the first lecture (thanks Chris!) and we will take bits and pieces from other sources. You can email me for the pdf of the course.

<p>
 	Each week, a few problems will be given out. I do not expect you to do all of them, but I will assume you read them. Exercises are either from the book or from different sources. I will be more than happy to discuss solutions either at the office, before or after the course, or via email.
