	<h2>Ph.D. student at Universiteit Gent</h2>
	<hr> 
		<p> 
			Since April 2019, I am working at Universiteit Gent in the broad topic of representation 
			theory of algebras with a focus on operator algebras and application to mathematical physics. 
			I did my bachelor and master degrees at Université de Montréal, the latter under the direction of Yvan Saint-Aubin
			on the representation theory of seam algebras, a generalization of Temperley-Lieb algebras.
		</p>
	
	
	<h3>Research interests </h3>
		<p> 
			I am now working on the algebraic underlying structure of operator algebras. The mathematics areas involved are plenty
			but I concentrate on representation theory and Lie superalgebras. A long-term goal is to investigate the potential of diagrammatic 
			algebras in this topic via the Hecke algebras framework and quantum algebras. More detailed introductory notes in my <a href="/research_notes/">research notes</a>.

	<h3>Mundane and trivia</h3>
		<p>
			I pass the ever so diminushing non-work time by reading, playing chess and swimming. Topics that might make me speak for too long include: 
			typography, government systems, late medieval European period, chess history,
			Émile Zola, Québec gins, Simone de Beauvoir and stories from <em>Dwarf Fortress</em>. If that seems interesting to you, more is available in my <a href="/blog/">personal blog</a>.
