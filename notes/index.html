<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
	<p> Here you will find some updates on research projects I have been working on. Those will be in a rather unpolished format and might prove hard to follow sometimes. If you think the idea might be useful to you or if you simply want to discuss about it, do contact me! </p>
  
  <ul class="notes">

	  {% for note in site.notes %}
	    <li><span>{{ note.date | date_to_string }}</span> Â» <a href="{{ note.url }}" title="{{ note.title }}">{{ note.title }}</a></li>
	  {% endfor %}
	</ul>
